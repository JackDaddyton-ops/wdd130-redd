            <p>Because my father served in the military as a radiologist, the footsteps of my childhood can be found all
                around the USA, and even out of it! The longest I have lived anywhere is 4 years at a time. Moving
                around is all I know, and every step of the way I had new friends, in a new environment. Being what is
                termed a “military brat” is a defining characteristic of my story.</p>

            <p>I have always been a big hobby guy, They make up a huge part of what I enjoy and who I am today. I have
                been able to use my talents to connect with people in all of the places I have lived. Some of my hobbies
                have changed throughout the years, and many of them are still the same. I like to consider myself a
                balanced and diverse person as far as my interests and hobbies go.</p>
