        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p id="intro">My hobbies have been a big part of my life since the beginning. They have defined who and what I
            spend my
            time with. I have always been a talented person, and my desire to be liked in the early days of my life
            accelerated my talents. My talents have come and gone through the years, but some have stayed consistent. If
            you want to get along with me, shared hobbies and interests is the fastest way!</p>

            <p>Hiking:</p>
            <p>My parent are very active people, I have been hiking and camping ever since I can remember. The colorful
                places I have lived have definitely help encourage me to spend time outside. I have always been an
                active person, and love the challenge of a wall to climb, or a mountain to summit.</p>

            <p>Sports:</p>
            <p>As shown in the image I played soccer when I was younger. I always remember my family tossing around a
                frisbee as a Sunday activity as well. My love for sports drew me to spike-ball when I was in high school
                which I still play much today. I also participated in cross-country running in high school as well.
                Surprisingly I picked up basketball and pickleball on my mission as well! I seldom turn down an
                opportunity to play some sports when the opportunity arises!</p>

            <p>Drawing</p>
            <p>I have been drawing since I was YOUNG! I would say I was drawing the most in middle-school and beginning
                of high school. I first loved drawing “rocket ships” when I was very young. Then I had a phase of
                drawing pirate ships. My final form as far as art has gone is drawing dragons. Sadly I do not do this as
                much as I used to, but I still have and love it!</p>

            <p>Legos/building</p>
            <p> was always running around with a lego creation mine when I was a kid. This is where my love for building
                and designing began. I played with legos until the end of high school. Now my outlet for these skill is
                designing things in 3D software programs. </p>

            <p>Dance</p>
            <p>Dancing is one of my biggest hobbies that I still do today! It started when I lived in California when I
                would watch dancers on YouTube. Marquese Scott is one of my great inspirations. When I was in high
                school I won 500$ doing a dance routine I came up with. I have made videos, but haven’t posted them
                (yet). My style incorporates hip hop and animation. If you dance like this then let me know! I need a
                hype group.</p>
