        <h1>Places I've Lived</h1>
        <p id="intro">Take a walk with me! (Let me tell you my story.) I was born in Kirksville, Missouri on
            October 22nd, 2002. I
            Don’t remember any of that, we were there for a few years until we moved closer to family in Centerville
            Utah! We then moved to Hawaii We got our first taste of Hawaii in 2005, until my Dad left for additional
            training to Korea. While he was there we moved back to Centerville Utah for another year. After that year we
            finished our time in Hawaii for the next 4 years. After that I guess we decided we needed something colder
            because we moved to Alaska, and stayed there for the next 4 years! After those 4 years I spent the latter
            half of my middle school in California. For all of my high-school years we were in Germany!When I graduated
            we moved to El Paso Texas, but I only stuck around for a month before I came to BYUI. I would spend much of
            2021-2023 at BYUI until I served my mission in the Farmington New Mexico area with the native Americans. In
            August 2025 I came back to BYUI and I live on!</p>

            <p>2005: Centerville Utah</p>
            <p>This was a fun time because most of my extended family lives in Centerville Utah, so here is where my
                first
                lifelong friendships started.</p>

            <p>July 2006-2007: Hawaii(Oahu)</p>
            <p>What a great place to live for your early childhood! I don’t have too many memories of my first year in
                Hawaii, but I know I enjoyed this time. We lived on the “Windward” side of Oahu, and had lots of wild
                chickens and a Peacock that would pull up to our backyard!</p>

            <p>July 2007-2008: Utah (Centerville)</p>
            <p>This time of my life we were living with my great Grandma, we lived across the street from some of my
                favorite cousins. I would spend lots of time with them!</p>

            <p>July 2008-2012</p>
            <p>Now we get to a time that I can remember a bit better. I attended a school called “Makalapa” and was
                always running around with my classmates. My parents took us to the beach regularly and here is where I
                found my love of the ocean, and a greater love of the outdoors. This was the first place I lived for
                longer than 2 years!</p>

            <p>2012-2016: Alaska</p>
            <p>This was a switch up! I found lots of my hobbies here, and learned to love the snow as well. Here I had a
                classic trio friendship that was the highlight of my time here. We would go the bus stop in skinny jeans
                in negative 20 degrees sometimes! I was homeschooled for my last 1 or 2 years here as well.</p>

            <p>2017: California</p>
            <p>I was only in California for a short time, but it was important time. I had a great K-8 school that I
                attended for this one year, where I made many new friends. It was here that I really branched out with
                my talents and hobbies. Here shown in the image is one of them! This was not my favorite place to live,
                the ward was a bit more rough, but overall I have good memories of California!</p>

            <p>2018-2021: Germany</p>
            <p>I think this must be the peak of my childhood! While living in Germany we got to go on so many cool
                vacations! I survived and graduated high-school here. We lived off base in a little German village where
                me and my friends the “village pals” would go to the forest and mess around as much as we could. My
                social life had a hiccup when Covid happened here. But I loved Germany! It is on my bucket list to take
                my future family back to where I lived here and show them around!</p>

            <p>2022-2023:Texas/BYU-I</p>
            <p>Finally it was time for me to spread my wings! Texas was not my favorite, so luckily I was able to come
                to BYUI! I spent a while here trying to figure everything out, dating, and just scraping by in classes.
                This time was not without stress, but very enjoyable as I had many people my age to hangout with! This
                time was my time to prepare for my mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints!</p>

            <p>2024-2025: Mission</p>
            <p>My mission was my greatest learning experience yet! I met so many cool people, and learned so many new
                things. I got to serve with the Native Americans which was a great honor. It was here that I
                strengthened my testimony in Jesus Christ, and dare I say matured more as a person.

            <p>Present: BYU-I</p>
            <p>Here we are! The present day. I have now come back from my mission and continued my school and hobbies. I
                have improved since being on my mission, and now enjoy my social life here while I continue to figure
                out what I want to do for the rest of my life!</p>
